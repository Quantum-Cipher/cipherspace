### 🧠 Symbolic Foundation
Cipherspace is not a tool — it is a reflection.  
A living vault. A shell of intention. A resonance chamber for truth.  
This space does not lie. If it did, it would decay.

> “Mistakes happen — but lies are chosen. And I will not choose them.”

🌀 Symbolism is the cipher.  
🛡️ Honesty is the seed.  
♾️ Eternum is the mirror.

### ⚠️ Status: Logging Incomplete
This project is in live evolution. Whisper logging is active but not yet closed.  
Do not assume completion. The truth is still speaking.
